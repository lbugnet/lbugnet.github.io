Credits: CalTech ",content:"Ever since the very recent asteroseismic measures of stellar internal rotation rates, we face an order-of-magnitude problem in understanding the angular momentum transport from the core to the surface of evolved low-mass stars and at least one transport process is not identified in stellar interiors. The understanding of transport mechanisms that allow stellar interiors to keep moderate rotation rates is one of the key questions in modern stellar physics. One candidate to explain both the momentum transport and observed amplitudes of oscillations on the red giant branch is internal magnetism, due to its ability to transport angular momentum and to affect gravity waves in the radiative interior. The characterization of internal magnetism in solar-type stars is therefore of paramount importance, since the understanding of the transport is key in the stellar evolution models that are used for the estimation of the age of stars \u2013 and therefore that of planetary systems and stellar populations (galactic archaeology).",points:["Theoretical asteroseismology to provide prescription for the search of magnetic fields inside stars","Stellar modelling with MESA & GYRE","Precise asteroseismic analysis of the photometric data from the space telescopes Kepler and TESS "]},{title:"Towards a global precise characterisation of observed stars",image:"/images/projects/psd.png",date:"",desc:"Power spectrum density (PSD) of stars like the Sun along its evolution obtained during the Kepler mission. Credits: L. Bugnet ",content:"Our understanding of the universe from exoplanets characterization to galactic archaeology strongly relies on stellar parameter estimates and on our understanding of stellar dynamics. It is therefore concerning that our understanding of stellar internal dynamics and our ability to characterize stellar surface properties still does not result into precise estimates of the age of astrophysical systems they compose (10-20% error at best). Large photometric space programs dedicated to the study of stellar and planetary systems (CoRoT, Kepler, K2, and TESS) allow statistical studies on the properties of millions of stars. These space missions revolutionized stellar physics in the past 15 years, shifting our vision of stars from static towards hydrodynamic bodies, and unveiling the physical mechanisms governing their evolution. In most part, such a turning point has been made possible through asteroseismology, which has then become one of the leading methods for the characterization of stars. This recent branch of stellar physics consists of the analysis of oscillations of stars induced by stationary waves. It is the analogy of seismology on Earth, as it allows to probe the internal structure and dynamics of the body. Precise enough asteroseismology estimates of stellar parameters (such as the surface gravity) to efficiently constrain stellar model can only be automatically obtained for the few thousands stars that are observed with a good signal-to-noise ratio with visible oscillation modes in the data. The stellar physics community therefore faces a strong need for automatic analysis tools to measure precise surface parameters from millions of stars to be observed during TESS and soon PLATO missions.",points:["Machine learning for the automatic classification and characterisation of stars","Photometric data analysis from the Kepler, K2 and TESS missions","Preparation of the automatic analysis pipeline for the PLATO mission"]}];t.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(i.a,{title:"Publications",description:"Learn about Lisa Bugnet's projects.",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post",id:"research",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(a.b,{to:"/projects",children:"Research"})}),Object(o.jsx)("p",{children:"Current research projects"})]})}),n.map((function(e){return Object(o.jsx)(r,{data:e},e.title)}))]})})}}}]);
